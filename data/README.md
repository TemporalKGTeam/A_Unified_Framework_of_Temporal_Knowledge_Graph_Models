**Description:** Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) consists of events that represent interactions between the socio-political actors (for instance, cooperative or hostile actions between individuals, groups, sectors and nation states). Each event consists of a source actor, event type, target actor and the event timestamp.  The events are automatically extracted from news articles by the BBN ACCENT event coder.
